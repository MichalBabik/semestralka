                    <p> It's time to return to the Wizarding World of "Harry Potter." Warner
                        Bros. Discovery has officially
                        announced its plan for a decade-long television series that will be "a faithful adaptation" of
                        J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" books.</p>

                    <p> The Harry Potter TV series is officially a go at Max, the streaming service known until today as
                        HBO Max.</p>

                    <p> The Warner Bros Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, announced the new service, which combines the
                        original
                        HBO Max with Discovery+, along with the tentpole series based on J.K. Rowling’s books, on during
                        a presentation on Wednesday, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</p>

                    <p> The live-action series, based on all seven books in the series published between 1997 and 2007,
                        will
                        become a “decade-long series produced with the same epic craft, love and care this global
                        franchise
                        is known for”, according to a statement from the newly branded Max. “The series will feature a
                        new
                        cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail, much-loved characters and
                        dramatic locations that Harry Potter fans have loved for over 25 years.”</p>

                    <p>“Each season will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible
                        adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will
                        remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch globally.”</p>

                    <p> Rowling will executive-produce the series, alongside Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts. David
                        Heyman,
                        who executive-produced all eight of the Harry Potter feature films (released between 2001 and
                        2011),
                        is also in talks to executive-produce.</p>

                    <p> Speculation over a potential TV series, which has been in the works since at least 2021, has
                        provoked mixed reactions among fans of the Potter universe. Though the extended world of Harry
                        Potter – the books, films, theatre show and video games — are worth an estimated $25bn (£20bn),
                        Rowling’s views on transgender rights have courted controversy and turned many fans away from
                        the
                        beloved coming-of-age series. </p>

                    <p> The author was absent from the 20th anniversary reunion special for the first feature film,
                        which
                        featured cast members reminiscing on their time together and the magic of the books and movies.
                        Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have spoken out against Rowling’s remarks on
                        transgender issues, while Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes have defended Rowling. </p>

                    <p> Warner Bros, the parent company of HBO, produced all eight of the Harry Potter movies and have
                        maintained close ties to Rowling in the years afterward. The studio has signed previous deals
                        with
                        Rowling for the Potter spin-off franchise Fantastic Beasts, the stage show Harry Potter and the
                        Cursed Child and theme parks in Florida and California. </p>

                    <p> “We are delighted to give audiences the opportunity to discover Hogwarts in a whole new way,”
                        said
                        Casey Bloys, the chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
                        “Harry Potter is a cultural phenomenon and it is clear there is such an enduring love and thirst
                        for
                        the Wizarding World. In partnership with Warner Bros Television and J.K. Rowling, this new Max
                        Original series will dive deep into each of the iconic books that fans have continued to enjoy
                        for
                        all of these years. </p>

                    <p> Rowling said: “Max’s commitment to preserving the integrity of my books is important to me, and
                        I’m
                        looking forward to being part of this new adaptation which will allow for a degree of depth and
                        detail only afforded by a long form television series.”</p>

                    <p>Details on cast, writers and a showrunner are yet to be announced.</p>
